### Background and motivation
With the transformation of economic structure, the current contradiction between the polarization of the occupational structure in China is prominent. The "China Employment Market Report" released by the China Employment Research Institute of Renmin University of China shows that talents in emerging industries are in short supply, and traditional industries are more competitive. For example, in the new economic industries such as the Internet, e-commerce, securities and transportation, the talents are in short supply under the dual promotion of the market and policies.

Therefore, our group decide to explore the current employment market, and analyze the employment situation for media graduates. All the data in our research are come from the website of "看准网", "boss直聘" and "智联招聘".

* Conclusion & suggestions:

1. Media companies with higher salary and rating rankings are generally located in Beijing and Shanghai, so you can give priority to these two cities if you are eager to become a media person.

2. The salary in the field of media was not satisfying comparing to other hot industry. But according to our analysis, if you have dream and are eager to enter the media industry, stick to your job for around 3 years and the salary will increase obviously.
